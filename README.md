## About Me

I’m **Dave Persaud**, a software developer currently in my second year at the **University of Guelph**, majoring in Software Engineering with a minor in Mathematics.

I’m passionate about **software development**, **mathematics**, and **cybersecurity**. I enjoy deconstructing complex systems to understand how they function and finding ways to make them more secure, private, and efficient. While much of my academic work is rooted in **C** and low-level systems, I have a strong background in **Java** and **Python**, and I am proficient in **R** for statistical analysis and **LaTeX** for technical documentation.

I consider myself a fast learner who thrives on solving logical puzzles and building tools that bridge the gap between theoretical math and practical software. I am currently **seeking internship or junior developer opportunities** where I can apply my skills in a professional environment and contribute to meaningful projects.
