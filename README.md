## About Me

I am a second-year **Software Engineering** student and **Mathematics** minor at the University of Guelph. I am driven by a curiosity for how complex systems function and a passion for making them more secure and efficient.

While my core expertise is in **C** and low-level systems, I am equally comfortable building in **Java** and **Python**. I leverage my mathematical background to solve logical puzzles, using **R** for statistical analysis and **LaTeX** for precise technical documentation. Currently, I am seeking **internship or junior developer opportunities** where I can apply my problem-solving skills to real-world challenges.
